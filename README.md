# Spring Practice Repository

This repository contains my practice projects and experiments with **Spring Framework**.  
The goal is to explore core concepts such as dependency injection, REST APIs, and backend development patterns.

## 🚀 Features
- Basic Spring Boot setup
- RESTful endpoints
- Configuration and dependency injection examples
- Practice code for learning and experimentation
